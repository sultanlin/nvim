# Snippet collection

This is a collection of VSCode-like snippets for my most commonly used languages. This was manually crafted thanks to the following sources and instruments:

- [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)
- [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets)
- [convert-snippets](https://github.com/VincentCordobes/convert-snippets)

## Add new collection

Steps to create new collection:

- Create and edit file using already present ones for reference.
- Update 'package.json' by adding another entry.

## Tips

- It is usually a good idea for a snippet to end with `$0` placeholder. In this case you can go to the end of the snippet using the same keys as jumping between nodes.
